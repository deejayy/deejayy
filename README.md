So, here it is, a README.md about myself. Sounds odd, though.

## Who am I

I'm a **developer**. Currently I'm working with frontend technologies, especially with Angular, but I've worked with a lot of others, too, like assembly, pascal/delphi, perl, php, pawn, etc. I also know some script languages, e.g. shell script, javascript, typescript, faded memories of powershell, etc. Of course, since I'm doing frontend work, I'm familiar with HTML and CSS, data exchange formats like JSON, XML, EDI, communication protocols and standards as HTTP, REST and the rest.

To be continued...
