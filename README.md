# DeeJayy

So, here it is, a README.md about myself. Sounds odd, though.

## Who am I

I'm a **developer** (let's say, since the millenium). Currently I'm working with frontend technologies, especially with Angular, but I've worked with a lot of others, too, like assembly, pascal/delphi, perl, php, pawn, etc. I also know some script languages, e.g. shell script, javascript, typescript, faded memories of powershell, etc. Of course, since I'm doing frontend work, I'm familiar with HTML and CSS, data exchange formats like JSON, XML, EDI, communication protocols and standards as HTTP, REST and the rest.

I know how to set up a fully functional linux server or a small company infrastructure. For that I'm working with iptables, apache, postfix & co, xen virtualization, bind, openvpn, sometimes docker.

I think you've already guessed I have a similar hobby as my 9to5 work.

Enough boring, here is what I've done and may be interesting.

## My projects

### Angular dependency graph drawer

To see something which can be hardly seen, connections, relations, critical egdes or just loose ends of your projects.

https://www.npmjs.com/package/ts-depgraph

### An API caller library for Angular

This is what evolved in the past years: a shortcut to API calling and result accessing with the help of NGRX state manager.

### Angular 10 "Initial Commit"

This is a repo I use when I want to quickly spin up an Angular project with a list of useful tools. Check the readme for them.

### Sound on keypress (up and down, too!), Windows only

A fun project to play a "click" sound when you press and release a key on your keyboard. I have a noise cancelling headphone but sometimes I just want to hear my typing :D

### ConsoleVision for Delphi

I don't really know how many years I put in this when I was young. My aim was to create a text-mode window manager and reimplement FAR Manager. I created other things with it, but not FAR Manager :) which went opensource some year later.

### Counter Strike related things

I hosted some CS 1.6 servers for years (for 16 to be exact). I always wanted to extend the dedicated server's functionality, so here are my tries.

https://github.com/deejayy/c4nn0n-cs-plugins - A custom AMXX plugin to fit my needs. It had IRC integration (I could communicate with the players inside the server without logging in), real-time monitoring through websockets (it has a nice frontend where I coul track the game, filter cheaters and such).  
https://github.com/deejayy/hl.js - HLDS + Nodejs (yes, you can call hlds features from javascript)  
https://github.com/deejayy/hlds-v8 - HLDS + v8 (same, but this is just v8)  

### Other repos

This github is hosting my projects from 2000, so you can bump into some retro sh\*t is well. I made a keylogger in assembly once (no animal was harmed!), a taskbar replacement for Win98, started a TTD clone with DirectX, and a bunch of other things, check them out if you are interested.
